Goal: Build a functional, console-based dice game utilizing JavaScript and its best practices.

Technologies: JavaScriptUser stories:(5 points): As a developer, I want to make consistent commits accompanied with good, descriptive commit messages.

(10 points): As a developer, I want to come up with a game concept played with dice, ensuring that my game concept is more complicated than “War”. When you have a concept, send it to the instructors via a group Slack message.

(10 points): As a developer, I want my game concept to be approved by an instructor, with part of the process being that I walk the instructor through my gameidea so that project user stories can be written out with the instructor.

(20 points): As a developer, I want my game to have gameplay functionality.

(10 points): As a developer, I want to have one function capable of “rolling a die” (by generating a random number), regardless of the number of sides.

(10 points): As a developer, I want to utilize six different dice within my game. (Recommended dice are 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, and 20-sided.Different dice may be substituted. No 2-sided die.)

Reminder: There is absolutely no front-end requirement for this project! The game can be ran/played entirely through the console or by using alerts and prompts. Any front-end work should come only after the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the game has been achieved.
